# Use case 6 - Build an intelligent banking assistant with MCP tools and Microsoft Agent Framework

## Introduction

In modern banking, customers expect quick, intuitive, and personalized
services without navigating complex applications. Traditional banking
interfaces often require multiple steps to perform simple tasks like
checking balances, viewing transactions, or making payments.

This use case demonstrates how an **AI-powered Banking Assistant Agent**
simplifies these interactions through a conversational interface. Users
can communicate in natural language, and the system intelligently
interprets their requests and routes them to specialized agents.

The solution is built using a **multi-agent architecture**, where each
agent handles a specific banking function such as account management,
transaction retrieval, and payment processing. An orchestrator
coordinates these agents to deliver accurate, real-time responses,
creating a seamless and efficient digital banking experience.

## Objectives

By implementing this use case, you will:

- Understand how to design a **multi-agent AI system** for real-world
  applications

- Enable **natural language interaction** for banking operations

- Implement **intelligent request routing** between specialized agents

- Integrate AI agents with **backend banking APIs and services**

- Automate common banking tasks such as:

  - Checking account balances

  - Viewing transaction history

  - Processing payments

- Enhance the system with advanced capabilities like **invoice-based
  payment processing**

- Deliver a **scalable and user-friendly conversational banking
  experience**
