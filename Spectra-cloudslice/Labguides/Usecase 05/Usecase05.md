# Use case 5 - Extracting Customer Insights from Conversations using Foundry IQ and AI agents

## Introduction

This usecase focuses on building an end-to-end AI-powered solution to extract meaningful customer insights from unstructured conversations and documents using Azure AI services and intelligent agents. Participants will deploy a complete cloud-based application using Azure Developer CLI, provision services such as Azure OpenAI, Cognitive Services, and Kubernetes, and integrate them into a scalable architecture.

The solution demonstrates how organizations can analyze housing reports, contracts, and conversational data to uncover trends, compare insights, and support data-driven decision-making. It also introduces the use of Foundry AI agents for advanced document analysis, summarization, and contextual querying.

## Scenario

In this usecase, you step into the role of a data analyst or AI engineer
working for an organization dealing with large volumes of **customer
conversations, housing reports, and contract documents**. The
organization faces a common challenge: valuable insights are buried
inside unstructured data such as PDFs, reports, and handwritten
contracts, making manual analysis slow, error-prone, and inefficient.

To solve this, the organization adopts an **AI-driven solution using
Azure Foundry and AI agents**. Your task is to design, deploy, and test
this intelligent system that can automatically process documents,
understand context, and generate meaningful insights.

## Objectives

- Understand and configure Azure resources including resource groups, subscriptions, and service providers.

- Deploy an AI-driven application using Azure Developer CLI (azd) and GitHub Codespaces.

- Provision and integrate services such as Azure OpenAI, Azure Cognitive Services, AKS, and Cosmos DB.

- Upload and process large volumes of documents for analysis (e.g housing reports, contracts).

- Use AI agents to:

  - Extract insights from documents

  - Compare reports and identify trends

  - Analyze structured and unstructured data

- Perform intelligent queries to generate summaries, tables, and comparative analysis.

- Validate deployment and test real-world use cases such as housing affordability analysis and contract evaluation.

- Clean up resources after completion to optimize cost and resource usage.

## Summary

In this lab, you successfully deployed a full-stack AI solution that
leverages Azure services and AI agents to analyze and extract insights
from customer-related data. You learned how to provision infrastructure,
deploy applications, and integrate multiple Azure services into a
cohesive system.

Through hands-on tasks, you explored how AI can process complex
documents such as housing reports and contracts, generate summaries,
perform comparisons, and extract key information like buyer/seller
details and financial insights. This demonstrates the practical value of
AI in transforming unstructured data into actionable intelligence.

Overall, the lab highlights how organizations can use AI-powered agents
and cloud-native tools to enhance decision-making, automate analysis,
and gain deeper insights from customer conversations and documents at
scale
