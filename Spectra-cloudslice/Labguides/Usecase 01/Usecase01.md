# Usecase 01 - Create a Knowledge Assistant agent for HR in Copilot Studio  that leverages Azure AI Search

## Overview

A large enterprise wants to reduce the time employees spend searching
for HR-related information (policies, benefits, leave guidelines, etc.)
spread across SharePoint, PDFs, internal wikis, and documents.

To overcome this issue, in this lab, you will build a **Knowledge
assistant** **agent** in **Copilot Studio** that uses **Azure AI
Search**, to index and semantically search across enterprise HR
documents.

## Lab Objective

- Exercise 1: Create an Azure AI Search resource
- Exercise 2: Create a Storage account
- Exercise 3: Create an Azure OpenAI Service and deploy a model
- Exercise 4: Create a vector index
- Exercise 5: Create a knowledge assistant agent
- Exercise 6: Add the Azure AI Search as a knowledge source

## Exercise 1: Create an Azure AI Search resource

In this exercise, you will create an Azure AI Search resource from the
Azure portal. This will be used to search the documents using AI
capability.

**Azure AI Search** is a cloud-based service for searching within your
privately curated data. It uses a combination of Microsoft’s AI and
JSON-based indexes to provide fast, relevant search results.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the **top search bar**, enter **Microsoft Foundry (1)**, and from the results, choose **Microsoft Foundry (2)** under the **Services**.

1. On the **Create a search service** page under the **Basics** tab, provide the following details:

     - Select the **Resource group** as **AgenticAI (1)** from the dropdown.
     - Enter **Service name**  as **searchleaves-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (2)**.
     - Choose the appropriate **Location (3)** based on your region or lab requirement.
     - Verify that the **Pricing tier (4)** is set to **Standard** (default selection).
     - Click on **Review + create (5)** to validate the configuration and proceed with deployment.

       ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
