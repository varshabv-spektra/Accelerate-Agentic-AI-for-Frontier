# Usecase 2- Building multi agent AI solution for streamlining Healthcare prior authorization workflows 

## Overview

In today’s rapidly evolving digital landscape, enterprises like
**Contoso Ltd.** face increasing pressure to streamline operations,
improve decision-making, and scale intelligent automation across
departments. Traditional automation approaches often fall short when
dealing with **complex, cross-functional workflows**, where multiple
systems, teams, and data sources must be coordinated efficiently.

To address these challenges, Contoso adopts the **Multi-Agent Solution
Accelerator**, an advanced AI-driven framework that leverages multiple
specialized agents working collaboratively to execute business
processes.

This accelerator enables organizations to design **intelligent,
agent-based workflows**, where each AI agent is responsible for a
specific function—such as data retrieval, reasoning, validation, and
execution. These agents operate in a coordinated manner, orchestrated
through a central system that interprets user requests and dynamically
assigns tasks.

Built on modern cloud technologies like **Azure OpenAI Service**,
**Azure Cosmos DB**, and containerized microservices, the solution
provides a scalable and extensible foundation for enterprise AI
applications.

**Business Scenario**

Contoso operates across multiple business units including **supply
chain, finance, customer service, and compliance**. Each department
relies on different systems and processes, resulting in:

- Fragmented workflows across departments

- Manual coordination causing delays and inefficiencies

- High risk of human errors in decision-making

- Limited scalability of automation initiatives

To overcome these challenges, Contoso implements a **multi-agent AI system** where:

**Multi-Agent Workflow**

1. **User Request Intake Agent**  
    Captures business queries (e.g., "Approve supplier contract" or
    "Analyze sales performance").

2. **Planning Agent**  
    Breaks down the request into smaller executable tasks.

3. **Data Retrieval Agent**  
    Fetches relevant data from enterprise systems (ERP, CRM, data
    warehouses).

4. **Reasoning Agent**  
    Applies AI models to analyze data and generate insights.

5. **Validation Agent**  
    Ensures accuracy, compliance, and business rule alignment.

6. **Execution Agent**  
    Triggers actions such as approvals, notifications, or report
    generation.
