# Hands-on Labs - Day 1

# Architect intelligent agents with Microsoft IQ and Foundry

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview

This lab demonstrates how Azure AI services can be combined to build enterprise AI solutions across multiple business scenarios. It covers three patterns: a HR knowledge assistant for policy retrieval, a multi-agent solution for healthcare prior authorization, and an enterprise automation framework for cross-functional workflows.

In the first scenario, you will build a Copilot Studio knowledge assistant that uses Azure AI Search and Azure OpenAI to retrieve information from HR documents through semantic and vector-based search. In the second, you will deploy a multi-agent AI solution that coordinates specialized agents to automate a healthcare prior authorization workflow. In the third, you will explore a broader orchestration framework designed for business processes such as onboarding, support, marketing, RFP analysis, and compliance review.

Across these scenarios, the lab shows how Azure AI Search, Azure OpenAI Service, Microsoft Copilot Studio, Azure Container Apps, Azure Cosmos DB, Azure App Service, Azure Storage, GitHub Codespaces, and Microsoft Foundry can be used together to build scalable, enterprise-ready AI applications.

## Objective

By the end of this lab, participants will be able to:

- Create and configure Azure AI Search, Azure Storage, and Azure OpenAI resources for AI-powered applications,

- Build a Copilot Studio knowledge assistant and connect it to Azure AI Search,

- Create a vector index and enable retrieval-augmented generation over enterprise documents,

- Deploy and validate a containerized multi-agent workflow using GitHub Codespaces and Azure Developer CLI,

- Provision and verify the Azure resources required for enterprise AI automation,

- Configure post-deployment settings such as authentication and sample data,

- Test AI-driven scenarios to observe how specialized agents work together to complete business tasks.

## Pre-requisites

Participants should have:

- An active Azure subscription with permission to create and manage resources,

- A valid GitHub account to fork the repository and use GitHub Codespaces,

- Access to Microsoft Copilot Studio and Microsoft Foundry,

- The required Azure resource providers registered in the subscription,

- Docker Desktop installed for container-based deployment tasks,

- Access to Azure and GitHub credentials for authentication during setup and deployment.
