# Hands-on Labs - Day 2

# Extend, ground and orchestrate intelligent agents

## Overall Estimated Duration: 4 Hours

## Overview
 
In this lab, you will design and implement an AI-powered **customer resolution agent** for Contoso Electronics by integrating multiple Microsoft AI capabilities. The solution combines **Azure AI Search**, **Microsoft Fabric**, **Microsoft Foundry**, and intelligent data ontologies to create a unified, AI-driven customer support system.
 
This use case simulates a real-world operations and support environment where customer issues such as shipment delays, refunds, and escalations are handled using AI-driven insights. The agent leverages structured data (orders, inventory, support tickets), unstructured data (emails), and policy knowledge to provide accurate recommendations and automate responses. By integrating **Work IQ (email)**, **Foundry IQ (policies)**, and **Fabric IQ (data)**, you will create a unified Copilot-like experience that enhances operational efficiency and customer satisfaction.
 
## Objectives
 
By the end of this lab, participants will be able to:
 
- Create and configure an **Azure AI Search** service for indexing and retrieving enterprise documents.
 
- Set up a **storage account** and ingest policy and operational documents for knowledge grounding.
 
- Build a **Foundry Agent** that acts as a customer support and operations assistant.
 
- Create a **Microsoft Fabric workspace and lakehouse** for storing and managing business data such as customers, orders, and shipments.
 
- Design an **ontology model** that defines relationships between entities like Customers, Orders, Support Tickets, and Refund Claims.
 
- Develop a **Fabric Data Agent** that can interpret business data and provide insights.
 
- Integrate **Work IQ (email), Foundry IQ (policies), and Fabric IQ (data)** into a unified agent.
 
- Enable the agent to:
  - Analyze customer issues
  - Validate data across systems
  - Apply business policies
  - Recommend resolutions
  - Generate professional responses
 
## Pre-requisites
 
Participants should have:
 
- A working knowledge of Microsoft Azure services, including resource groups, virtual machines, Azure Storage, and Azure AI services.
 
- Basic familiarity with Microsoft Fabric, including workspace and lakehouse concepts.
 
- Understanding of AI concepts such as embeddings, ontologies, and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG).
 
- Familiarity with data modeling and entity-relationship concepts.
 
- Knowledge of Azure role-based access control (RBAC) and authentication methods.
 
- General awareness of how AI services integrate with data platforms for intelligent decision-making.
 
- Basic understanding of email and communication workflows in enterprise environments.
 
## Explanation of Components
 
The architecture for this lab involves the following key components:
 
**Azure AI Search**: 
- Cloud-based service for searching privately curated enterprise data.
- Uses a combination of Microsoft's AI and JSON-based indexes to provide fast, relevant search results.
- Enables semantic search across policy documents and operational knowledge.
- Supports hybrid search (keyword + vector-based retrieval).
 
**Microsoft Foundry**:
- Central hub for building and managing AI agents.
- Provides the **Foundry Agent** that orchestrates customer resolution workflows.
- Integrates multiple **IQ** tools (Work IQ, Foundry IQ, Fabric IQ) into a unified interface.
- Manages agent instructions, tools, and knowledge bases.
 
**Microsoft Fabric**:
- Unified analytics platform for data engineering and data science.
- **Lakehouse**: Stores business data (customers, orders, shipments, support tickets, refunds).
- **Ontology (Preview)**: Defines entity types (Customer, Order, OrderItem, SupportTicket, RefundClaim, ShipmentTrackingEvent) and relationships (Places, Contains, hasSupportTicket, hasTrackingEvent, mayLeadTo).
- **Fabric Data Agent**: Interprets business data and answers questions about customer orders, shipments, refunds, and inventory.
 
**Azure Storage Account**:
- Blob storage for hosting policy documents, communication standards, and operational knowledge.
- Provides document indexing for **Azure AI Search**.
- Serves as the knowledge base for **Foundry IQ**.
 
**Work IQ (Email Integration)**:
- Provides email analysis and context extraction.
- Allows the agent to review customer and internal communications.
- Extracts key information about customer issues, complaints, and urgency.
 
**Foundry IQ (Policy Knowledge)**:
- Knowledge base connected to policy documents stored in Azure Storage.
- Enables the agent to apply business rules, SLA guidance, escalation criteria, and communication standards.
- Ensures consistent, policy-compliant decision-making.
 
**Fabric IQ (Data Intelligence)**:
- Ontology-based data interpretation layer.
- Provides business-context-aware responses by understanding entity relationships.
- Enables the agent to validate customer facts, order details, inventory status, and shipment history.
 
**Integration Flow**:
1. **Issue Intake**: Work IQ analyzes incoming customer emails to understand the issue and urgency.
2. **Data Validation**: Fabric IQ queries the lakehouse to validate customer, order, inventory, shipment, and support facts.
3. **Policy Application**: Foundry IQ applies internal policies and SLA guidance to determine eligibility for replacements, refunds, or escalations.
4. **Recommendation**: The Foundry Agent synthesizes all information to recommend the best resolution.
5. **Response Generation**: The agent drafts clear, professional customer-facing or internal responses based on the analysis.
