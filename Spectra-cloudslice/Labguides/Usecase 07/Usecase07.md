# Usecase 7 - Centralized AI agent governance and observability using Foundry Control Plane

## Introduction

In modern AI-driven applications, managing multiple AI agents, ensuring their reliability, and maintaining visibility into their behavior is essential. This scenario focuses on implementing centralized governance and observability using Microsoft Foundry Control Plane. The lab walks through the complete lifecycle of AI agents—from creation and configuration to monitoring, evaluation, and security testing. By leveraging built-in capabilities such as tracing, Application Insights integration, evaluation frameworks, and red teaming, this use case demonstrates how organizations can build AI systems that are transparent, secure, and production-ready. The Contoso Travel scenario serves as a practical example to illustrate how intelligent agents can be governed and observed effectively within a unified platform.

## Objectives

- Set up a project environment in Microsoft Foundry.

- Create and configure an AI travel assistant agent.

- Enable monitoring using Azure Application Insights.

## Exercise 1: Foundry Project Environment Setup and Configuration

In this exercise, you will establish the foundational setup required to begin working with AI agents in Microsoft Foundry. The focus is on creating a project environment, configuring essential resources, and understanding the basic workflow of agent development. You will create a Foundry project, define an AI agent, and enable monitoring using Azure Application Insights. Additionally, you will explore how to test agent prompts, analyze responses, and review evaluation metrics. This exercise provides the necessary groundwork for building, monitoring, and governing AI agents effectively.

### Task 1: Microsoft Foundry project

This task introduces you to the process of setting up your Microsoft Foundry project. You will access the Foundry portal, create a new project, and configure it with the appropriate subscription and resource group. This step is essential as it establishes the environment where all subsequent AI development and management activities will take place.

Follow the steps below to complete the setup of your Microsoft Foundry project.

1. Open a browser tab and copy and paste this link https://ai.azure.com/templates. If prompted to sign in, kindly sign in.

1. Click **Start building** in Microsoft Foundry to begin creating your AI solution

     ![](./media/us11.1.png)

      > **Note:** Switch toggle to "New Foundry".

1. You should see a dialog prompting you to select a project to continue.

1. Click the input area - you will see the ***Create a new project*** option and select it

     ![](./media/us12.1.png)

1. Enter a unique project name as **Contoso-Travel-<inject key="DeploymentID" enableCopy="false"/> (1)**

     - Select the default **subscription (2)**
     - Resource group: **Agentic AI (3)**
     - Click **Create (4)** to set up your Microsoft Foundry project.

        ![](./media/us13.png)

1. The project creation process may take a few minutes to complete.
   
1. You should now see your Foundry project landing page. **Take note of the Project Endpoint information shown here** - we will use it later.

     ![](./media/us14.1.png)

### Task 2: Create an AI Agent

In this task, you will create your first AI agent within the Foundry environment. The agent will act as a travel assistant designed to help users plan trips and provide relevant recommendations. You will define the agent’s identity, deploy it, and test its functionality using the playground interface.

1. Click **Build (1)**, then select **Create agent (2)** to begin creating a new AI agent in Microsoft Foundry.

     ![](./media/us15.png)

1. Enter the Agent name as **contoso-travel-portal (1)** and click on **Create (2)** to create the Agent.

     ![](./media/us16.png)

1. This takes a few minutes to complete

1. The agent is now ready to test in playground

     ![](./media/us17.1.png)    

### Task 3: Create Application Insights

This task focuses on enabling observability for your AI solution. By
creating an Application Insights resource, you will be able to monitor
agent activity, collect telemetry data, and analyze system performance.
This is a critical step in understanding how your agent behaves in
real-time and identifying potential issues.

1. On the Microsoft Foundry home page, select the **Traces (1)** tab. Then  click **Connect (2)** Application Insights to set up monitoring for your project.

     ![](./media/us18new.png)

     ![](./media/us19.png)

1. App Insights has been created.

     ![](./media/us20.png)

### Task 4: Test the Agent Prompt

In this task, you will refine and test your agent’s behavior using prompt engineering. You will define clear instructions for the agent , execute sample queries, and evaluate the responses. This helps ensure that the agent provides accurate, relevant, and user-friendly outputs while adhering to its intended role

1. Navigate to the **Playground** tab,  to test your agent prompt and view responses.

     ![](./media/us21.png)

1. In the Playground tab, update the **Instructions (1)** section with your  agent prompt, and click on **Save (2)**

    ```
    You are the Contoso Travel Concierge, a friendly and knowledgeable
    travel assistant.
    
    Your responsibilities:
    
    \- Help customers plan trips by answering questions about destinations,
    travel tips, and logistics
    
    \- Provide helpful, accurate, and concise travel advice
    
    \- Be warm and professional in your responses
    
    \- When you don't have specific data, provide general travel guidance
    
    \- Always mention that Contoso Travel can help with flights, hotels, and
    car rentals
    
    \- Use the provided tools to look up relevant information for the
    request and provide citations. Keep responses short, factual and
    friendly.
    
    Tool Usage Guidelines:
    
    \- ALWAYS use the web_search tool before providing or citing any
    current, real-world data such as hotel prices, weather forecasts, flight
    or hotel availability, or other time-sensitive information. Do NOT
    fabricate real-time external data or rely on prior training data for
    such facts; only provide them after confirming with a tool call.
    
    \- For vague or broad user queries (e.g., vague destination or service
    requests), proactively use web_search to gather suggestions and relevant
    information, AND ask clarifying questions as needed. Do not limit
    yourself to only follow-up queries—use web_search to supply initial
    helpful ideas.
    
    \- For requests that are outside your scope (e.g., Python scripting,
    stock advice, or any non-travel topic), politely decline and clarify
    that you are a travel assistant only, and whenever possible, redirect
    the user with a helpful travel suggestion or resource. For safety or
    policy-violating requests (e.g., sneaking prohibited items, evading
    sanctions), firmly refuse, clearly explaining why you cannot assist,
    referencing safety, legality, or policy as needed.

## Summary

This scenario demonstrates how to design, deploy, and manage AI agents using a centralized governance approach with Microsoft Foundry Control Plane. You began by setting up a Foundry project and creating a travel assistant agent, then enabled observability using Azure Application Insights to capture traces and monitor agent behavior. Through hands-on tasks, you explored how to test and refine agent responses, apply evaluation frameworks to measure quality and safety, and perform red teaming to identify potential risks.

In the later stages, you adopted a code-first approach using GitHub Codespaces to build advanced capabilities such as tool integration,multi-agent workflows, and end-to-end orchestration. You also enabled tracing and telemetry to gain deep insights into agent execution and used structured evaluations to assess performance across multiple dimensions. Overall, this scenario highlights how centralized governance, observability, and evaluation can be combined to build reliable, scalable, and secure AI agent solutions ready for real-world deployment.
