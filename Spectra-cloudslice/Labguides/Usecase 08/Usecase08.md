# Usecase 08 - Safeguard your agents with AI Red Teaming Agent in Microsoft Foundry

## Scenario

Zava is a fast-growing technology and services company that manages large volumes of internal documentation, product manuals, training material, and customer-support knowledge. Employees frequently need quick, accurate responses without manually searching through dozens of files and knowledge repositories.

To improve efficiency, Zava wants to deploy an intelligent AI-powered assistant that can read, understand, and retrieve answers from its internal documents. The company chooses Azure AI Agent Service to build an interactive chat interface, where employees can simply ask a question and receive a precise, citation-supported answer grounded in Zava's internal knowledge.

## Introduction

As organizations adopt AI agents to automate workflows, answer questions, and retrieve internal knowledge, ensuring these systems
behave safely and reliably becomes critical. Zava, a fast-growing technology company, is deploying an internal AI knowledge assistant to help employees quickly retrieve information from documents, manuals, and
training materials. To protect this AI agent against harmful behavior, security gaps, or unintended responses, Zava leverages Microsoft Foundry's AI Red Teaming capabilities.

This use case demonstrates how to build a secure end-to-end AI agent, evaluate its behavior, detect risks through automated red teaming, and monitor its performance using Azure's observability tools. Through guided steps, you will deploy the agent, test its retrieval capabilities, run red teaming evaluations, and enforce continuous monitoring to ensure safety, accuracy, and compliance.

## Objectives

- Understand how to build a document-aware AI knowledge assistant using Azure AI Agent Service.

- Deploy Azure resources and configure the full solution using Azure Developer CLI.

- Interact with the AI agent using predefined and custom prompts to validate retrieval accuracy.

- Execute built-in evaluators to measure agent quality, safety, intent resolution, and tool-call correctness.

- Run automated AI Red Teaming tests to identify vulnerabilities, harmful behaviors, or safety violations.

- Analyze red teaming results in Microsoft Foundry, including attack strategies and failure cases.

- Enable tracing, monitoring, and continuous evaluation to track real-time agent behavior in production.

- Learn best practices for securing AI agents through consistent testing, observability, and model governance.

## Task 7: Agent Evaluation

Microsoft Foundry offers a number of built-in evaluators to measure the quality, efficiency, risk and safety of your agents. For example, intent resolution, tool call accuracy, and task adherence evaluators are
targeted to assess the end-to-end and tool call process quality of agent workflow, while content safety evaluator checks for inappropriate content in the responses such as violence or hate. You can also create custom evaluators tailored to your specific requirements, including custom prompt-based evaluators or code-based evaluators that implement your unique assessment criteria.

1. Go back to **GitHub Codespaces**, open the terminal, and run the Python requirements script below to set up your environment

   ```
   python -m pip install -r src/requirements.txt
   ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may beincorrect.](./media/image65.png)

## Task 8: AI Red Teaming Agent

The AI Red Teaming Agent is a powerful tool designed to help organizations proactively find security and safety risks associated with
generative AI systems during design and development of generative AI models and applications.

In the red teaming test script, you will be able to set up an AI Red Teaming Agent to run an automated scan of your agent in this sample. The test demonstrates how to:

- Create a red-teaming evaluation

- Generate taxonomies for risk categories (e.g., prohibited actions)

- Configure attack strategies (Flip, Base64) with multi-turn
  conversations

- Retrieve and analyze red teaming results

No test dataset or adversarial LLM is needed as the AI Red Teaming Agent
will generate all the attack prompts for you.

1. Run the below script to set the variable

    ```
    export AZURE_EXISTING_AGENT_ID="agent-template-assistant:1"
    ```

1. Run the red teaming test in your local development environment:

    ```
    pytest tests/test_red_teaming.py -s
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image72.png)

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image73.png)

1. Upon completion, the test will display an URL in the output where you can review the detailed red teaming evaluation results in the Microsoft Foundry UI, including attack inputs, outcomes, and reasons.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

## Task 9: Tracing and monitoring

1. Enable tracing by setting the environment variable

    ```
    azd env set ENABLE_AZURE_MONITOR_TRACING true
    ```

1. Deploy the resources

    ```
    azd deploy
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image79.png)

## Task 10: Console traces

1. You can view console traces in the Azure portal by executing the below command. You can get the link to the resource group with the azd tool:

    ```
    azd show
    ```

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image80.png)

    >**Note:** Choose your container app from the list of resources in the resource group. Then open 'Monitoring' and 'Log Stream'. Choose the 'Application' radio button to view application logs. You can choose between real-time and historical using the corresponding radio buttons. Note that it may take some time for the historical view to be updated with the latest logs.

## Task 11: Agent traces and Monitor

You can view both the server-side and client-side traces, cost and
evaluation data in Microsoft Foundry.

1. Go back the Microsoft Foundry and select agent.

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
incorrect.](./media/image81.png)

1. Select the **Traces**

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be

    ![Monitor Dashboard](./media/image86.png)

## Task 12: Continuous Evaluation

Continuous evaluation is an automated monitoring capability that continuously assesses your agent's quality, performance, and safety as it handles real user interactions in production.

During container startup, continuous evaluation is enabled by default and pre-configured with a sample evaluator set to evaluate up to 5 agent responses per hour. Continuous evaluation does not generate test
inputs-instead, it evaluates real user conversations as they occur. This means evaluation runs are triggered only when actual users interact with your agent, and if there are no user interactions, there will be no evaluation entries.

To customize continuous evaluation from the Microsoft Foundry:

1. Select **Monitor.** Choose the agent you want to enable continuous evaluation for from the agent list and click on **Settings**

    ![A screenshot of a computer AI-generated content may be
 incorrect.](./media/image87.png)

1. Enable **Continuous evaluation (1)**, set the **Sample rate** as 1 (2), and click **Submit (3)** to apply the monitoring settings.

## Summary

In this use case, you built and secured an AI agent capable of retrieving information from Zava's internal documents using Azure AI Agent Service. After deploying the environment and verifying key resources-including Container Apps, Azure Cosmos DB, Storage, Search, and Foundry-you interacted with the agent to test its ability to answer operational and product-related queries. You then performed automated evaluations using Microsoft Foundry's assessment tools and executed comprehensive AI Red Teaming scans to uncover potential risks. Finally, you enabled tracing, logging, and continuous evaluation to monitor real-world usage and ongoing model safety. This end-to-end workflow equips Zava with a reliable, secure, and scalable AI assistant that provides accurate information while meeting enterprise-grade safety and governance standards.
